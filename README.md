**How do Kickin' Keto Gummies work?**
=====================================

Kickin' Keto Gummies are a convenient option that supports adherence to a low-carb, but high-fat diet. They contain a mixture of BHB salts that stimulate the body to use fat instead of carbohydrates for energy - this process is called ketosis. So, they work by triggering the metabolic process of ketosis in the body, which helps to burn excess fat cells and use them as a source of energy. Moreover, gummies act as appetite suppressants and prevent overeating. Through these processes, energy levels increase and better mental performance is supported. It also helps reduce cravings and prevents the body from storing excess fat.

The gummy candies lower blood sugar levels and provide energy throughout the day. They also provide a source of protein that can help build muscle mass. In addition, the gummy bears are rich in antioxidants that can promote health and slow down the aging process.

**What exactly is ketosis anyway?**
===================================

Ketosis is a metabolic state that the body reaches when it uses mainly ketones as an energy source. Normally, the body gets its energy from the carbohydrates contained in food. However, when carbohydrate intake is severely restricted, as is the case with the ketogenic diet, the body draws on fat reserves to produce ketones and use them as an energy source.

During the ketogenic diet, carbohydrate intake is reduced to about 20-50 grams per day, which causes the body to use up glycogen stores in the liver and muscles. Once these glycogen stores are depleted, the body begins to convert fat in the liver into ketones, which are then used as an alternative energy source.

The state of ketosis has several potential benefits. First, it can help reduce body fat, as the body in ketosis tends to use fat as its primary energy source. Second, it can lead to stable blood sugar levels, which can be especially beneficial for people with diabetes or insulin resistance. Third, ketosis can help reduce cravings and increase feelings of fullness, which can lead to a natural reduction in calories.

However, it is important to note that ketosis is not for everyone. People with certain medical conditions such as type 1 diabetes or those who are pregnant or breastfeeding should be cautious and seek medical advice before considering a ketogenic diet or ketosis-inducing measures.

Achieving and maintaining ketosis requires patience and discipline. It is important to control carbohydrate intake while consuming adequate fat and a moderate amount of protein. A balanced diet that provides adequate nutrients is critical to maintaining health during the ketogenic diet.

It is also important to note that ketosis does not need to be maintained permanently. Many people follow a ketogenic diet temporarily to achieve certain goals, such as weight loss or improved metabolic health.

**The gummies contain the following ingredients:**

Green Coffee

Green Tea

BHB

Garcinia Cambogia

**The modes of action of each ingredient are described in more detail below:**

**Green Coffee:**

Green coffee is a beverage made from unroasted coffee beans of the Coffea fruit (Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora). It is said to contain more of a naturally occurring compound called chlorogenic acid than roasted coffee. This is said to be beneficial to health and contribute to weight loss, among other benefits. It is reported to lower blood pressure and help control diabetes.

Some research suggests that green coffee may help not only weight loss, but also reduce chronic inflammation in the body, which can lead to many different diseases. However, more studies are needed in this regard.

The main ingredient in green coffee is chlorogenic acid, which can curb appetite and promote weight loss. It also has antioxidant properties that can protect against free radical damage and fight inflammation in the body. In addition, it contains caffeine, which stimulates the metabolism and thus can additionally help with weight loss.

A study of 40 obese women found that taking 400 mg of green coffee extract per day along with a reduced-calorie diet resulted in greater weight loss than following the reduced-calorie diet alone. Another study showed that green coffee extract can improve blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity.

**Green Tea:**

The polyphenols in green tea are called catechins and contain six main polyphenols: Catechin, Gallocatechin, Epicatechin, Epigallocatechin and Apigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). They have been shown to help the body burn fat, increase metabolism, inhibit fat absorption, reduce oxidative stress and increase energy expenditure. In a small laboratory study, drinking full-strength green tea was found to improve fat oxidation by 12% at rest and during exercise. It also increased fat oxidation after exercise.

Other benefits of green tea include its anti-cancer properties. It also helps reduce the effects of oxidative stress, which can damage cells and cause chronic diseases such as heart disease.

Green tea may also be beneficial for diabetics because it contains flavonoids called polyphenols, which can help regulate blood sugar levels by reducing the production of glucose in the liver and lowering cholesterol levels. A study published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health found that women who drank five or more cups of green tea per day had a 26% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes than women who drank only one cup.

**BHB:**

BHB is a molecule produced by the liver and gut bacteria to keep the body running during times of food shortage or starvation. It is also a popular supplement for people following the ketogenic diet and can be found in many forms, including ketone salts, exogenous ketones and MCT oil. The best way to boost BHB production in your body is to eat foods that trigger the metabolic process of ketosis. You can also use a keto-friendly supplement Kickin' Keto Gummies.

When your body is in ketosis, your liver and intestines begin producing ketones, which are used as fuel for cells and provide an alternative to glucose as an energy source. Your brain uses this energy for mental clarity and concentration, and for skeletal muscle it is the preferred fuel source. Unlike glucose, ketones are immediately absorbed into the bloodstream and converted to acetyl-CoA for use by cells, making them a fast-acting fuel for the brain and body. For this reason, a ketogenic diet can boost memory, concentration and attention. Research suggests that the ketones found in BHB may help protect against neurodegeneration and even stimulate the regrowth of neurons and synapses in the brain - a process known as neuroprotection.

Your heart is another organ that can benefit from BHB. While the heart prefers glucose as an energy source, it can also use ketones and quickly switch to them during exercise, which reduces inflammation and oxidative stress. This is good news for anyone looking to improve their cardiovascular health and slow the aging process.

**Garcinia Cambogia:**

Garcinia Cambogia is a fruit native to India and Southeast Asia. The peel of this fruit contains an active ingredient called hydroxycitric acid (HCA). HCA blocks an enzyme in the body that converts excess carbohydrates into fat. This process can help prevent the accumulation of body fat, especially in the abdominal area. It also increases serotonin levels, which can increase feelings of fullness. In a small study, Garcinia cambogia significantly lowered triglyceride levels in obese adults. The garcinia cambogia group also lost more weight and belly fat than the placebo group.

**Intake and dosage**

Kickin' Keto Gummies are always taken alternately: five days in a row, two days off, five days in a row, two days off, and so on.

You can take the gummies at any time of the day. The effect improves if you drink some water afterwards.

### **Possible side effects of Kickin' Keto Gummies.**

The Kickin' Keto Gummies support the process of ketosis. A ketogenic diet, whether using the Gummies or not, can temporarily aul a so-called keto flu.

The so-called "keto flu" is a term used to describe the possible symptoms and side effects that some people may experience during the first few days or weeks of a ketogenic diet. It refers to temporary discomfort that can occur when the body is switched from a high-carbohydrate diet to a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet.

**The keto flu is not experienced by all people who start a ketogenic diet, but it is not uncommon to experience some temporary symptoms. These may include:**

**Fatigue and lack of energy:** During the first few days of the ketogenic diet, you may experience a lack of energy as your body switches its primary energy source from carbohydrates to fat. This can lead to temporary fatigue and listlessness.

**Headaches**: Some people report headaches during the adjustment period. This may be due to the loss of water and electrolytes that may occur at the beginning of the ketogenic diet.

**Dizziness and lightheadedness:** another possible symptom of the keto flu is dizziness or a general feeling of lightheadedness. This may also be due to the loss of water and electrolytes.

**Digestive problems:** a change in diet, especially an increase in fat consumption, may temporarily cause digestive problems such as constipation or diarrhea.

These symptoms are usually temporary and usually disappear within a few days to a few weeks as the body adjusts to the new diet. It is important to note that not everyone experiences these symptoms and that their intensity can vary from person to person.

**To minimize the effects of the keto flu, there are some steps you can take:**

Consume sufficient fluids and electrolytes: It is important to stay well hydrated and consume adequate electrolytes such as sodium, potassium and magnesium during the transition to the ketogenic diet.

Gradual transition: one can slowly reduce carbohydrate intake and gradually increase fat intake to give the body time to adjust.

Balanced diet: a balanced and varied diet can help minimize possible nutrient deficiencies and provide the body with all the necessary nutrients.

Rest and relaxation: it is important to give your body enough rest and listen to your body during the transition to the ketogenic diet.

In conclusion, the keto flu is a temporary phase that can occur when adapting to the ketogenic diet. With proper preparation and support, you can minimize these symptoms and enjoy the potential long-term benefits of the ketogenic diet.
